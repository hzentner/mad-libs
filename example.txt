I don't come from your average ADJECTIVE family . That's because we're all part of the LAST_NAME Family rock band and we lead a very ADJECTIVE life . For example , by not shaving his NOUN every morning , my dad saves enough time to practice the ADJECTIVE drums . My brother doesn't participate in extracurricular PLURAL_NOUN at school because he plays the electric NOUN . My ADJECTIVE sister doesn't have time to date PLURAL_NOUN because she sings lead vocals and practices for four or five hours every NOUN . When I'm not writing our ADJECTIVE songs , I'm playing the PLURAL_NOUN on the keyboard , so I don't have any free time either . Finally , Mom is our ADJECTIVE manager . She books our band to play at weddings and ADJECTIVE sixteens . Maybe someday , if we practice ADVERB enough , we'll get to make a music video for LETTER_OF_THE_ALPHABET - TV and play sold-out shows at Madison Square NOUN !
